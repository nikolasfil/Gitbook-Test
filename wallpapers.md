# Wallpaper Directories

grub images /usr/share/images/desktop-base there are the  
lockscreen /etc/lightdm/wallpaper.jpg
boot screen /usr/share/images/desktop-grub.jpg
animation screen /usr/share/plymouth/themes/parrot/

SO 

in the /usr/share/desktop-base/parrot-theme/wallpaper/contents/images
are the images that the suspend screen is choosing from 

Now I did change them all to the same login wallpaper.png 
but they dont have the same dimensions 
so bout to fix that sometimes 
not now 

I just replaced all the images and it works
